# All About Me
#### Mourik Chaganti
## Introduction
#### My name is Mourik Chaganti, I was born in michigan, but moved to Missouri at a young age. I practically was raised in Missouri. I enjoy playing sports, video games, and trying new things. Currently one of my favorite things right now is videography and photos. I have a old camera I take photos when im with my friends. Another thing I enjoy is cliff jumping. Now that the weather is getting better i am excited to hopefully find some new cliff jumping spots and have fun. I also enjoy looking at the sunset.
